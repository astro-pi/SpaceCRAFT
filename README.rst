IN PROGRESS!!!

SpaceCRAFT is a python module and collection of programs which displays data from the `Raspberry Pi`_ `Astro Pi`_ computer in `Minecraft Pi Edition`_.

SpaceCRAFT was conceived by Hannah Belshaw, from Cumnor House Girlâ€™s School, and was the `Primary School Winning Entry`_ in the `Astro Pi`_ competition, it was created by Martin O'Hanlon (`Stuff about=code`_) for the `Raspberry Pi`_ foundation.

* spacecraft - the spacecraft python module and programs
* poc - proof of concept code used in the development
* scripts - useful scripts!

Usage
=====

Data logger
-----------
The spacecraft/astropidatalogger.py program reads data from the astro pi computer and writes it to a CSV files - it is run using::

    usage: astropidatalogger.py [-h] [-v] filename timetorun interval
   
    Astro Pi Data Logger
   
    positional arguments:
      filename       The output filename
      timetorun      The time in seconds the logger should run for
      interval       The time in seconds between each write

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  Output verbose debug statements

e.g. to run the data logger for 180 seconds reading data every 1 second::

    sudo python3 astropidatalogger.py /home/pi/datafile.csv 180 1

Data reader
-----------
The spacecraft/astropidatareader.py program reads CSV files created by the astropidatalogger.py program, its not invisage it is used to view data, but as a method for testing a file has been created successfully and as well as being an example of how to use the AstroPiDataReader::

    usage: astropidatareader.py [-h] [-v] filename
    
    Astro Pi Data Reader
    
    positional arguments:
      filename       The input filename
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  Output verbose debug statements

e.g. to read in the file /home/pi/datafile.csv::

    sudo python3 astropidatareader.py /home/pi/datafile.csv

Interactive Minecraft Astro Pi
------------------------------
The spacecraft/mcinteractiveastropi.py program creates a interactive astro pi in Minecraft which when hit (right clicked) with a sword it responds with a description and makes the interacts with the real astro pi.

Start Minecraft: Pi edition, select/create a new game::

    sudo python3 mcinteractiveastropi.py

The AstroPi model will appear above the player, fly up and hit the model to interact with it.

Documentation
=============

Astro Pi Data
-------------
The spacecraft.astropidata module contains 2 classes:

* AstroPiDataLogger - writing data from the astro pi computer to a file
* AstroPiDataReader - reading it back

AstroPiDataLogger
`````````````````
The AstroPiDataLogger::

    AstroPiDataLogger(verbose = False)

It is started by using the start() function and expects the following parameters to be passed:

* filename - the path and filename where the astro pi data is to be written
* timetorun - the time in seconds that the data logger should run for
* interval - how often in seconds the data logger should write to the file

To read data from the astro pi every 1 second for 180 seconds to the file /home/pi/astropidata.csv you would use the following code::

    #import AstroPiDataLogger
    from spacecraft.astropidata import AstroPiDataLogger
    
    #create the data logger
    logger = AstroPiDataLogger()
    
    #start the data logger
    logger.start("/home/pi/astropidata.csv", 180, 1)

AstroPiDataLogger can be made to print verbose progress messages by passing True when it is created::

    logger = AstroPiDataLogger(True)

AstroPiDataReader
`````````````````
The AstroPiDataReader reads data files created by the AstroPiDataLogger::

    AstroPiDataReader(filename, verbose = False)

An open file error will be returned in the file cannot be opened. 

When the file is open it can be iterated and read using the following functions:

* rowcount -> integer - returns the number of rows in the file
* next() -> bool - moves to the next row in the file, returns False if there are no more rows
* previous() -> bool - moves to the previous row in the, returns False if at the start of the file
* currentrow -> integer - returns a 0 based value for the current row
* get_time() -> integer - returns the time the row was created, in seconds since the epoch
* get_temperature() -> float - returns the temperature in C
* get_temperature_from_humidity() -> float - returns the temperature in C from the humidity sensor
* get_temperature_from_pressure() -> float - returns the temperature in C from the pressure sensor
* get_pressure() -> float - returns the pressure
* get_humidity() -> float - returns the humidity
* get_orientation() -> dict - returns the orientation in degress as a dictionary of "pitch", "yaw", "roll"
* get_orientation_in_degrees() -> dict - returns the orientation in degress as a dictionary of "pitch", "yaw", "roll"
* get_orientation_in_radians() -> dict - returns the orientation in radians as a dictionary of "pitch", "yaw", "roll"
* get_compass_raw() -> dict - returns the raw compass values as a dictionary of "x", "y", "z"
* get_gyroscope_raw() -> dict - returns the raw gyroscope values as a dictionary of "x", "y", "z"
* get_accelerometer_raw() -> dict - returns the raw accelerometer values as a dictionary of "x", "y", "z"
* get_cpu_temperature() -> float - returns the temperature of the cpu
* get_joystick() -> dict - returns whether the joystick was pressed (1 for pressed, 0 for not pressed) as dictionary of "up", "down", "left", "right", "button"

To loop through each row in a data file and print it to the screen you would use the following code::

    #import AstroPiDataReader
    from spacecraft.astropidata import AstroPiDataReader
    
    #create the data reader
    reader = AstroPiDataReader("/home/pi/astropidata.csv")

    #are there any rows?
    if reader.rowcount > 0:

        #keep looping until its the end of file
        found_row = True
        while(found_row):

            #get the time the row was created
            timedata = reader.get_time()
            print("Time = {}".format(timedata))
    
            #move to the next row
            found_row = reader.next()

Data file
`````````
AstroPiDataLogger creates a `CSV`_ file which contains the following fields seperated by a comma . This structure can be read by the AstroPiDataReader as well as text editors (such as Leafpad or Notepad) and spreadsheet applications (Excel, Sheet).

The Python Constant is used internally within the AstroPiLogger and AstroPiReader classes to reference fields.
The File Header is output on the first row the CSV file.

Minecraft Models
----------------

SpaceCRAFT contains a number of minecraft models, in the spacecraft.mcmodels module, which you can include in your programs:

* ISS - the international space station
* MCAstroPi - a Raspberry Pi with Astro Pi Sense HAT attached
* Rocket - a rocket similar to those drawn my children in the 80's
* LaunchPad - a launchpad for the rocket to sit on
* Arrow - a multicoloured arrow, really useful for showing the direction and orientation
* Stairs - a helter skelter styled stair case leading up

ISS, MCAstroPi, Rocket, LaunchPad, Arrow
````````````````````````````````````````
To create a model you need to pass a minecraft connection and a position of where you want the model::

    #import ISS model from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import ISS
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft module
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where you create the model
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create the ISS
    iss = ISS(mc, pos)

These models are all based on (inherited from) the minecraftstuff.MinecraftShape class and supports the following:

* move(x, y, z) - move the shape to a specific x, y, z
* moveBy(x, y, z) - move the shape by that number of blocks in x, y, z
* rotate(yaw, pitch, roll) - rotate the shape by a yaw, pitch and roll (in degrees)
* rotateBy(raw, pitch, roll) - rotate the shape by that angle
* clear() - clear the model
* draw() - draws the model if it has been cleared
* redraw() - redraws the model
* reset() - resets the model back to its original position and rotation
* setBlock(x, y, z, blockId, blockData) - sets a block within the model, the positions are relative not absolute
* setBlocks(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, blockId, blockData) - creates a suboid of blocks in the model, again positions are relative
* getShapeBlock(x, y, z) -> minecraftstuff.ShapeBlock - returns the block in the shape which is at that absolute position
* position -> mcpi.minecraft.Vec3(x, y, z) - the position of the shape in Minecraft
* visible -> boolean - whether the shape in visible

Rocket
``````
The rocket model can also be launched using the launch(height) function, height is the number of blocks the rocket should fly upwards::

    #import rocket model from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import Rocket
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft module
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where you create the model
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create the rocket
    rocket = Rocket(mc, pos)

    #launch the rocket 50 blocks up
    rocket.launch(50)

Stairs
``````
To create the stairs, you need to pass:

* a minecraft connection
* a position of the bottom of the stairs
* the width of the stairs - how many blocks each leg is
* the height - how many blocks the stairs should go up for
* a block type of what you want to stairs to be made from
* a optional block data value 

::

    #import Stairs from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import Stairs
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft and mcpi block modules
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    from mcpi import block
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where the stairs will start
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create some stairs which have a width of 5 blocks, go up for 50 blocks and are made of STONE
    stairs = Stairs(mc, pos, 5, 50, block.STONE.id)
