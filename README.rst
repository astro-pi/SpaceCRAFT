* spacecraft - the spacecraft python module and programs
* poc - proof of concept code used in the development
* scripts - useful scripts!

Usage
=====

Data logger
-----------

The spacecraft/astropidatalogger.py program reads data from the astro pi computer and writes it to a CSV files - it is run using::

    usage: astropidatalogger.py [-h] [-v] filename timetorun interval
   
    Astro Pi Data Logger
   
    positional arguments:
      filename       The output filename
      timetorun      The time in seconds the logger should run for
      interval       The time in seconds between each write

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  Output verbose debug statements


e.g. to run the data logger for 180 seconds reading data every 1 second::

    sudo python3 astropidatalogger.py /home/pi/datafile.csv 180 1

Data reader
-----------

The spacecraft/astropidatareader.py program reads CSV files created by the astropidatalogger.py program, its not invisage it is used to view data, but as a method for testing a file has been created successfully and as well as being an example of how to use the AstroPiDataReader::

    usage: astropidatareader.py [-h] [-v] filename
    
    Astro Pi Data Reader
    
    positional arguments:
      filename       The input filename
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose  Output verbose debug statements

e.g. to read in the file /home/pi/datafile.csv::

    sudo python3 astropidatareader.py /home/pi/datafile.csv

Interactive Minecraft Astro Pi
------------------------------

The spacecraft/mcinteractiveastropi.py creates a interactive astro pi in Minecraft which when hit (right clicked) with a sword it responds with a description and makes the interacts with the real astro pi.

Start Minecraft: Pi edition, select/create a new game::

    sudo python3 mcinteractiveastropi.py

The AstroPi model will appear above the player, fly up and hit the model to interact with it.

Documentation
=============

Astro Pi Data
-------------
The spacecraft.astropidata module contains 2 classes:

* AstroPiDataLogger - writing data from the astro pi computer to a file
* AstroPiDataReader - reading it back

Data structure
``````````````
The AstroPiDataLogger creates a `CSV`_ file which contains the following fields seperated by a comma . This structure can be read by the AstroPiDataReader.

===================== =========================== ===============================================

The Python Constant is used in conjunction with the AstroPiLogger and AstroPiReader classes to reference fields.
The File Header is output on the first row the CSV file.

AstroPiDataLogger
`````````````````
The data logger only contains one function, start(filename, timetorun, interval), which expects the following parameters to be passed:

* filename - the path and filename where the astro pi data is to be written
* timetorun - the time in seconds that the data logger should run for
* interval - how often in seconds the data logger should write to the file

To read data from the astro pi every 1 second for 180 seconds to the file /home/pi/astropidata.csv you would use the following code::
    #import AstroPiDataLogger
    from spacecraft.astropidata import AstroPiDataLogger
    
    #create the data logger
    logger = AstroPiDataLogger()
    
    #start the data logger
    logger.start("/home/pi/astropidata.csv", 180, 1)

AstroPiDataLogger can be made to print verbose progress messages by passing True when it is created::
    logger = AstroPiDataLogger(True)

AstroPiDataReader

Minecraft Models
----------------

SpaceCRAFT contains a number of minecraft models, in the spacecraft.mcmodels module, which you can include in your programs.

The following minecraft models are included:

* ISS - the international space station
* MCAstroPi - a Raspberry Pi with Astro Pi Sense HAT attached
* Rocket - a rocket similar to those drawn my children in the 80's
* LaunchPad - a launchpad for the rocket to sit on
* Arrow - a multicoloured arrow, really useful for showing the direction and orientation
* Stairs - a helter skelter styled stair case leading up

ISS, MCAstroPi, Rocket, LaunchPad, Arrow
````````````````````````````````````````
To create a model you need to pass a minecraft connection and a position of where you want the model::
    #import ISS model from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import ISS
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft module
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where you create the model
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create the ISS
    iss = ISS(mc, pos)

These models are all based on (inherited from) the minecraftstuff.MinecraftShape class and supports the following:

* move(x, y, z) - move the shape to a specific x, y, z
* moveBy(x, y, z) - move the shape by that number of blocks in x, y, z
* rotate(yaw, pitch, roll) - rotate the shape by a yaw, pitch and roll (in degrees)
* rotateBy(raw, pitch, roll) - rotate the shape by that angle
* clear() - clear the model
* draw() - draws the model if it has been cleared
* redraw() - redraws the model
* reset() - resets the model back to its original position and rotation
* setBlock(x, y, z, blockId, blockData) - sets a block within the model, the positions are relative not absolute
* setBlocks(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, blockId, blockData) - creates a suboid of blocks in the model, again positions are relative
* getShapeBlock(x, y, z) -> minecraftstuff.ShapeBlock - returns the block in the shape which is at that absolute position
* position -> mcpi.minecraft.Vec3(x, y, z) - the position of the shape in Minecraft
* visible -> boolean - whether the shape in visible

Rocket
``````
The rocket model can also be launched using the launch(height) function, height is the number of blocks the rocket should fly upwards::
    #import rocket model from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import Rocket
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft module
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where you create the model
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create the rocket
    rocket = Rocket(mc, pos)

    #launch the rocket 50 blocks up
    rocket.launch(50)

Stairs
``````
To create the stairs, you need to pass:

* a minecraft connection
* a position of the bottom of the stairs
* the width of the stairs - how many blocks each leg is
* the height - how many blocks the stairs should go up for
* a block type of what you want to stairs to be made from
* a optional block data value 

::
    #import Stairs from spacecraft.mcmodels
    from spacecraft.mcmodels import Stairs
    
    #import mcpi.minecraft and mcpi block modules
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
    from mcpi import block
    
    #create connection to minecraft
    mc = Minecraft.create()
    
    #get the players position, this will be where the stairs will start
    pos = mc.player.getTilePos()
    
    #create some stairs which have a width of 5 blocks, go up for 50 blocks and are made of STONE
    stairs = Stairs(mc, pos, 5, 50, block.STONE.id)
